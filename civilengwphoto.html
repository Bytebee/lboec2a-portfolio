    <P> Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and
        maintenance of
        the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams,
        airports,
        sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.They are responsible for ensuring
        that public
        structures are safe to use, tough, and made to last. While Architects draw up ideas for buildings, Civil
        Engineers work on
        execution, planning and ensuring that the structure is safe to use for the public.
